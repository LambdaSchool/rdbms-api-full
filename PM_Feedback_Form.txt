## Base Project:


Build an API that persists data to SQLite3.

Use knex migrations to create the following database tables:

- [] Users

- [] Posts

- [] Tags

## Establish a many to many relationship between Posts and Tags. The same tag can be added to different posts and a post can have multiple tags. Add any tables necessary to accomplish this.

## Seed test data into your tables using knex.

## Implement the following endpoints::


- [ ] Users
- [ ] Posts
- [ ] Tags

## Extra Credit


- add a [GET] /posts/:id/tags endpoint that returns all tags for the post with the specified id.
- have the post returned by the [GET] /posts/:id endpoint include the user name(not the id) and the tags associated with the post.
